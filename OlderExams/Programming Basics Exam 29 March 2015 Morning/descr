    Problem 1 – Torrent Pirate
</h2>
<p>
    Captain Jack Sparrow is a famous pirate. He loves to steal different stuff
    just for fun and he loves watching movies. He recently discovered a brand
    new technology called peer-to-peer or torrent. After he browsed a famous
    site, he made a <strong>collection of movies</strong> he would like to
    download. Assume 1 movie has a size of<strong> 1500MB</strong>. Jack
    doesn’t want to pay for the internet, so he decided to go to the mall and
use the free Wi-Fi there. The Wi-Fi has a fixed speed of    <strong>2MB/s</strong>. Unfortunately for Jack, his wife will be going with
    him to the mall and this means that the download would not be free at all.
She likes to buy sandals and other useless stuff. You are given the    <strong>money </strong>his wife spends<strong> per hour </strong>at the
    mall.
</p>
<p>
Your task is to help Jack <strong>calculate </strong>whether it is    <strong> cheaper</strong> to go to the mall and download the movies or go
    to the cinema to watch them. If the amount is the same, Jack still wants to
    make his wife happy, so he goes to the mall.

<h3>
    Input
</h3>
<p>
    The input data should be read from the console. It consists of three input
    values, each at a separate line:

        Download data <strong>d</strong>: how much <strong>megabytes</strong>
        in total Jack should download.
    </li>
    <li>
Price of cinema <strong>p</strong>: how much        <strong>money would cost</strong> Jack to go to the cinema to watch one
        movie.
    </li>
    <li>
Wife spending <strong>w</strong>: how much        <strong>money per hour</strong> does Jack’s wife spend.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is
    no need to check it explicitly.
</p>
